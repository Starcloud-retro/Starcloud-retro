🚀 Welcome to My Digital Cosmos
Where stellar algorithms orbit innovative ideas, and code unlocks the universe's secrets!
I'm a tech visionary fueled by AI, Machine Learning, and the enchanting world of astrochemistry. I code with Python, Java, and C to conquer data structures, algorithms, and scalable architectures. Currently, I'm engineering a game-changing AI-IoT women's safety & health bracelet — blending real-world impact with cutting-edge tech.
As a second-year B.Tech student specializing in CSE–AI&ML at Geethanjali College of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad, Telangana, I thrive on academic projects, hackathons, and open-source contributions. My work? Modular masterpieces that scale like a supernova!
But wait, there's more to this galaxy:
